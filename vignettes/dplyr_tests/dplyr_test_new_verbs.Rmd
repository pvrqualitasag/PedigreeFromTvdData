title: "dplyr - Testing New Verbs"
output: html_notebook
---

This notebook shows some scratch ideas and experiments with dplyr and the verbs to change certain values within a variable

## A simple example
We get started with a few examples from `?dplyr::case_when` 

```{r}
require(dplyr)
x <- 1:50
case_when(
  x %% 35 == 0 ~ "fizz buzz",
  x %% 5 == 0 ~ "fizz",
  x %% 7 == 0 ~ "buzz",
  TRUE ~ as.character(x)
)
```

## Usage and Arguments
```{r, include=FALSE}
s_dpcw <- "`dplyr::case_when`"
s_dpcw_hf <- paste0("?", s_dpcw) 
```

From the sections __Usage__ and __Arguments__ in the help file of `r s_dpcw_hf`, we can see that `r s_dpcw` can take any number of arguments which is denoted by the three dots. The arguments must be a sequence of two sided formulas. A two-sided formula consists of a LHS and a RHS which are separated by a tilde (`~`). For the purpose of the arguments in `r s_dpcw`
