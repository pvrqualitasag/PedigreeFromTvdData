## Disclaimer
This vignette describes concepts, strategies and systematics developed for running data consistency checks for pedigree data.


## Introduction
From a theoretical point of view, pedigrees are __Directed Acyclic Graphs__ (DAG), where a graph $G$ is defined by the set of vertices or nodes $V$ and the set of edges $E$. The set of vertices correspond to the set of individuals in the pedigree. Edges correspond to directed relationships from parents to their offspring. In a pedigree, the direction of the edges is always from parents to offspring. A pedigree must not contain any directed cycles, i.e. there cannot be any path corresponding to a series of directed edges linked together where a parent appears after one of its offspring. These two properties 

1. directed edges between parents and offspring
2. no cycles

together have led to the name DAG.

In a directed graph, we can distinguish between the number of edges that are coming into a node and the number of edges going out of a node. The former number is called `in-degree` and the latter number corresponds to the `out-degree`. For a pedigree, the maximum in-degree for every node is $2$.

Based on the described properties, we can define a set of consistency requirements that must be fullfilled when a pedigree is constructed.


## Consistency Requirements
This section describes consistency requirements that are derived from the properties of a pedigree described in the previous section.

### Properties of a DAG
The following list of requirements is derived from the properties of a DAG

* Uniqueness of individuals: Considering the fact that a pedigree is a DAG and the definition of the nodes as a set, it follows that nodes must be unique. Hence every individual can only appear once in our pedigree. As a consequence of that, we can use the IDs associated to the nodes as unique mean of identification. In the database-world this corresponds to a primary key, meaning that a primary key uniquely identifies a given record.

* No cycles: The property of a pedigree being acyclic was already described in the previous section

* In-degree of nodes: The maximum in-degree of every node is $2$.

* Parents older than offspring: Parents must be older than offspring

* Parents must have the correct sex

### Other requirements
There are additional properties which are more related to data-processing issues. Those issues mostly involve the correctnes of certain data-formats.

* correct formats of IDs for individuals and parents
* correct formats of birthdates


## Implementation
Implementations do depend among many things on the type of data representation of a given pedigree. 

### Data representation
One of the most commonly used data representation of a pedigree is the so-called node-list or adjacency list. This is a tabular list with columns containing IDs for animals, IDs for parents and additional information such as sex and birthdate. One row of the list corresponds to the available information for a given individual and hence must be unique. Such a row is also called a pedigree record.

### Types of implementation routines
When it comes to verifying the consistency requirements two type of implementation routines can be imagined

* __checks__ are routines which take a pedigree and a condition given by a specific requirement. The only thing they do is they search the pedigree for entries which do not fullfill the consistency condition. As a result, the check-routines return the set of primary keys found not to fullfill the conditions. From a implementation design point of view it is important to note, that the check-routines work without any side-effects on the pedigree.
* __transformations__ take a pedigree as input and give as output a different pedigree where one of the following two operations were applied
    + invalidate or delete a complete pedigree record or 
    + invalidate or delete a field of the pedigree record
    
The descriptions of each check is described in a different vignette which is also available in this package.
